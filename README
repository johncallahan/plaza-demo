# scrum

FIXME: write description

## Usage

Build th project:

      $ lein deps

Start the src/scrum/webapp.clj with

      $ lein repl

You'll get this WARNING for now: 

  WARNING: spit already refers to: #'clojure.core/spit in namespace: ring.util.servlet, being replaced by: #'clojure.contrib.duck-streams/spit

Then, open up a new shell and use curl to hit the webapp server on port 8081:

      curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/"
      curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/Celebrity"
      curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/Celebrity?name=Alonzo
      curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/Celebrity?surname=Church" (should get 2 records)
      curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/Celebrity?name=George&surname=Church" (will add a new record)

The last command will NOT persist the record.  The static data is in the file test.xml
